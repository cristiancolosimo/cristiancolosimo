### Hi, I'm Cris

I am a student of an IT institute, who during the day studies C, Java, HTML, and at night he tries his hand at programming high efficiency programs with alternative methods using modern frameworks and programming languages such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

I hate inefficient language and framework of point of ram and cpu usage like C#, Java and Ruby

My favourite games are: 
  - Minecraft (modded all life)
  - Nier automata
  - Subnautica
