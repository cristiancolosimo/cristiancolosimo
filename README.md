### Hi, I'm Cris

I am a student of an IT institute, who during the day studies C, Java, HTML, and at night he tries his hand at programming high efficiency programs with alternative methods using modern frameworks and programming languages such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

I dislike inefficient language and framework of point of ram and cpu usage like C#, Java and Ruby in contexts where a more optimized language could be used


Current Setup: 
  - CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700x
  - RAM: 32 GB 3200 MHz CL16 16x2
  - GPU: RTX 2070 Super 
  - ROM: 1TB SSD NVME GEN 3.0
  - OSs: dualboot Arch Linux BTW, WIN11 


My favourite games are: 
  - Hollow knight
  - Minecraft (modded always with 150+ mods and a good shaders)
  - Nier automata
  - Subnautica
  - Ori
